            <p>After realizing that I need to reattempt Unit 1 at Lambda, I quickly realized what a great idea it was! Since doing so I have been able to refine my skills of the basic fundamentals of coding. My projects from last month have been re-done in a very visually appealing way, whereas the originals looked like a child completed them. Lambda has been and will continue to be a great springboard into my new career as a web developer!</p>
